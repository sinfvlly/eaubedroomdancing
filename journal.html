                    <p>staring at a blank page, finding it hard to write, but knowing you feel the need to say something. 
                    i always find that strange to deal with. strong feelings that turn into nothing, it's frustrating. it's especially hard when starting a new journal, like i am now, here. 
                    so i'm just rambling to have something on the page. it makes it easier for next times.
                    <br></p>
                    <p>i'm feeling so indecisive on the layout of my site. i keep seeing other people's sites and wanting to do the same thing entirely. 
                    i love maximalism but everything i do ends up being very minimalistic, i'm never sure why. 
                    as of writing this, the site isn't even done yet, but i already wish to fully change it. 
                    i should leave it as is for now and change it some other time, but it just bothers me! <br></p>
                    <p>perhaps i should just make each page unique to each own. each topic has it's own page for a reason, so give them their own personality.
                    notes for myself, haha. well for this page i definitely like it being very plain.
                    just me and my thoughts, nothing influencing the way i talk. thought i doubt other pages will be much more different.
                    <br></p>
                    <p>i'll leave this first post as this for now! i might post a whole lot in a short amount of time, or disappear for months, who knows. 
                    i do hope anyone reading, enjoys my random blog!</p>
